# Zlyme roadmap

Miyoo Flip (`my355`) is the only supported device. This file says where the work is. It is not the architecture. Current behavior is in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the other owning documents. How to write this file is in `docs/WRITING.md`.

The long record that used to live here was moved on 2026-10-15 to [docs/archive/roadmap-2026-10-15.md](archive/roadmap-2026-10-15.md). The immutable reference is `b926b9976c12ccdb3de20b629f8a550e574f8e51`. Four relative links in that copy were retargeted for `docs/archive/`. Sentences there that say Phase 13 is not scoped are that day's plan.

## Where we are

Phase 13 is open on `zlyme44.3-phase-12`. `ZLYME_VERSION` is `zlyme44.3`. No `zlyme44.3` image or release exists. The published release is `zlyme44.2`, runtime `9b7d91d5ce6e36764aa663748a92ef7e7be6f3f3`, run `38098037074`. The installed Flip image is still the Phase 12 E32 archive. Phase 14 does not start until Phase 13 is accepted and that branch is on `main`. The checklist is in `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`.

Host-tested means a host check passed. It is not a Flip result. Blocked means the item stopped on the limit named there. Planned means the source is not on this branch yet.

## Phase 0. Repository and baseline

Objective: make the tree's documents, board hooks, and `my355` identity explicit without changing runtime behavior.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-22. Both my355 defconfigs configured, and a clean product image booted to NextUI.

Reference: `docs/LOGBOOK.md`, 2026-09-22.

## Phase 1. Application-scoped Weston

Objective: run a Wayland or X11 program without a permanent compositor.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-23. Temporary Weston recovered NextUI on Panfrost and libmali. WestonPack and Wine returned the same way. No open work.

Reference: [docs/research/weston.md](research/weston.md).

## Phase 2. Kernel patch audit

Objective: classify the inherited Linux patches against the selected kernel, upstream, the hardware wiki, and current comparison trees, then remove only what that audit justified.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-23. Evidence pin `8984f6106c99f89bde214a3beeec3ee4bc175ba7`. Eighteen Linux patches remained. Joypad, deep suspend, and DMC stayed in later phases.

Reference: [docs/research/kernel-patch-audit.md](research/kernel-patch-audit.md).

## Phase 3. Built-in gamepad

Objective: replace the ROCKNIX joypad stack with `miyoo-flip-gamepad` for the Flip's UART pad.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-25. Original sticks, buttons, MENU, and rumble were accepted. Switch 1 replacement sticks were a compatibility target and were not called validated.

Dependency: the hardware and protocol record. Applications were Phase 4.

Reference: [docs/research/joypad-driver.md](research/joypad-driver.md), [docs/archive/roadmap-phase-3c.md](archive/roadmap-phase-3c.md).

## Phase 4. InputPlumber

Objective: give each application one virtual `xb360` pad per player. The built-in pad stays the calibration device.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-28. Accepted image `zlyme-my355-20260927-0b139e9099ee.tar` from `0b139e9099eec699e31d1cb5313998f57f387e12`. External controllers were not part of that acceptance.

Reference: [docs/research/inputplumber.md](research/inputplumber.md).

## Phase 5. Second patch reduction

Objective: drop kernel patches the new gamepad and the newer kernel made obsolete, and record what stayed.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-28. The first accepted runtime is `7eaecf794830a15c53f6b417a1b408dd31ceee53`. The corrected stack that entered Phase 6 is `8119387e0fdb729f1f013bed9dbc48c76e37a1df`. `7eaecf79` was not rewritten as that later stack.

Reference: [docs/research/kernel-patch-audit-phase5.md](research/kernel-patch-audit-phase5.md).

## Phase 6. Deep suspend

Objective: enter and leave Linux mem suspend through the existing RK3568 BL31 path, from the menu and from a game, using the power button.

Status: Closed. Accepted runtime `b709719aac5c5540394d0369e5e06981b8aa00bc`. The PM config driver stays built in. RK817 `005` stayed unapplied. Lid-open wake was not measured. The 2026-10-15 lid-close work does not add that measurement.

Not a closure requirement: long cycle counts, a standby-current number, and a full USB or radio matrix. Those were not claimed.

Reference: [docs/research/deep-suspend-phase6.md](research/deep-suspend-phase6.md).

## Phase 7. DMC module

Objective: run the RK3568 DMC devfreq driver as an out-of-tree module instead of a kernel patch.

Status: Closed. Accepted runtime `21de8081d6e6a419d708e8f3c792e4f1357eaafc`. `1012a` and `1012b` are gone. DFI patch `1010` stayed. A later failure-path correction, `70acb1d27443447df84903e2043a2af05dbd9ee3`, was source-reviewed and was not given its own hardware run.

Reference: `package/drivers/rk3568-dmc/README.md`.

## Phase 8. NextUI fork

Objective: fetch Zlyme's NextUI from a pinned commit, keep other-platform source in the fork, and leave `/boot` read-only.

Status: Closed, 2026-09-30. Hardware-equivalent runtime `7a0fc397cb5b3e0f7c4b19f4f3abe8626eaccaf8`. The profile did not justify a frontend optimization. Upstream pins were not moved.

Reference: [docs/research/frontend-source-phase8.md](research/frontend-source-phase8.md).

## Phase 9. First stable release

Objective: finish the product surface for the first stable `zlyme44` and publish it from a clean remote build.

Status: Closed, 2026-10-04. Implementation `337ccbce2587393463a4b49c551f94e33e318e44`. The maintainer accepted the 2026-10-03 image, including a ZcrapeGoat cheat and a root-sized delta. Run `37164297221` published `zlyme-37164297221`.

Reference: [docs/research/product-phase9.md](research/product-phase9.md).

## Phase 10. Documentation

Objective: make the owning documents match the source, and add the maintenance index, without a new product feature.

Status: Closed, 2026-10-06. Accepted source `6a398b311310246ef6a5515ed72805c6f58d787d`. `zlyme44.1` was not published. Run `37375071442` was dispatched with `publish_release` false. Deferred findings `(i)`, `(m)`, `(n)`, and `(q)` were not Phase 10 blockers. `(i)` later changed in Phase 12A1.

Reference: `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`, [docs/research/documentation-audit-phase10.md](research/documentation-audit-phase10.md).

## Phase 11. zlyme44.2

Objective: ship the Settings, runtime, and recovery work that became published `zlyme44.2`.

Status: Closed, 2026-10-08. 11A and 11B were hardware-accepted on 2026-10-06. 11C's recovery preloader was hardware-accepted on 2026-10-08. Erase is not USB MASKROM. The published runtime is `9b7d91d5ce6e36764aa663748a92ef7e7be6f3f3`. PortMaster mounts left behind by `PORTS.pak` were Phase 12 preflight, not a 44.2 gate.

Reference: `docs/LOGBOOK.md` and the archived roadmap. The UART logs are in the hardware wiki.

## Phase 12. zlyme44.3 development

Objective: battery, SSH, clock, updater, launch logs, Buildroot 2026.08, PanVK as an experimental opt-in, unused kernel-test cleanup, and USB File Transfer.

Status: Closed, 2026-10-14, after the same-day correction. The installed image is the E32 archive, squashfs `ac46ac3783ed4d9bcc9bbceed1d6b023c65a878cd50561b11dc119980d06c24c`. It was built before `ZLYME_VERSION` became `zlyme44.3`. The maintainer accepted ordinary MTP on that image, including a second start with the cable left in place, one PortMaster port on the second card, and charging and upper-port host use by report. The maintainer presented one orange frame twice. PPSSPP did not present a game through PanVK. The archive `7951a37668e3` is an earlier file-copy baseline, not this accepted image.

Limits, not open work: within-session cable removal was not measured, E30 stays the rollback for that limit, and `snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk` stays. A discharge to 0% was not run. The maintainer required no further Phase 12 hardware test. WestonPack cleanup and removal of obsolete PAKs are not a new hardware gate.

The hardware wiki was updated for the development Linux 7.2.10 boot and the lower-port session. That update does not call the device tree proven.

Dependency: published 44.2 source. No Phase 12 item waits on a wiki edit.

Reference: [docs/research/usb-mtp-phase12d.md](research/usb-mtp-phase12d.md), [docs/research/linux-7.2.10-migration.md](research/linux-7.2.10-migration.md).

## Phase 13. Compatibility on this branch

Phase 13 is not closed. It stays on `zlyme44.3-phase-12` for the same eventual `zlyme44.3` release. Nothing here is on the installed E32 image. The maintainer has not asked for a Phase 13 hardware run yet. 13E6 is that later candidate.

13A, the rest of 13B, 13C2, and 13D are host-tested. B6 and C1 are outstanding limitations. They are not implemented, and they are separate from Phase 13E release-readiness. Phase 13B is not complete because of B6. Phase 13 as a whole is not closed. Whether that final scope is accepted waits on the maintainer. Phase 12's hardware campaign stays closed. 13E has not started. Credits for B7, B8, D1, and D2 stay in those commit messages, not in the README.

The earlier 13E list, E1 through E4, is in the archive. The milestones below replace it.

### Phase 13A. Small corrections

Objective: branding rebuild, the Windows Basic Data partition type, MTP names, VTree translations, the README lockup width, and the Unreleased cleanup.

Status: Host-tested, 2026-10-15. No image was built for these items. No open work inside 13A.

Reference: the archived roadmap, section Phase 13A.

### Phase 13B. RetroArch and emulators

Phase 13B is not complete. B6 is an outstanding limitation. It does not hold the Phase 13E work.

##### B1. Menu confirm and back

Objective: menus confirm with A and go back with B. Game actions stay.

Status: Host-tested. No separate menu-confirm setting disagreed with the game map, so those bindings were left alone.

##### B2. Stock emulator configuration

Objective: ship one stock file, copy it only when the user's file is missing, and let an explicit reset replace it. Launchers do not rewrite an existing file.

Status: Host-tested. The 2026-10-15 host test of launcher-time key insertion does not validate this policy.

Dependency: NextUI `2d95d33` added the RetroArch reset row. `7cb6ecaa` added lid-close mem. This branch pins `3f4120cc`. About reads Syncthing through `zlyme-syncthing-gui`. None of those commits is on NextUI `zlyme` yet.

##### B3. RGUI theme

Objective: stop forcing the custom Zlyme theme. Classic Orange is the stock default this pin understands.

Status: Host-tested. An existing file that still names the old theme stays until the configuration reset.

##### B4. Standalone RetroArch tool

Objective: Tools → RetroArch starts `ra-run` with no ROM.

Status: Host-tested.

##### B5. Persistent libretro cores

Objective: copy packaged cores to `/storage/.config/retroarch/cores/`. A reboot leaves a hand-replaced shipped core. A new image refreshes the filenames it ships. A core the image does not ship stays.

Status: Host-tested. The 2026-10-15 host test of the tmpfs symlink directory does not validate this policy. Cores are real files. The first copy is about 213 MiB and was not timed on a Flip.

##### B6. Readable RetroArch menu

Objective: make RGUI text usable on the Flip with options the pinned RetroArch already has.

Status: Blocked. RetroArch 1.22.2 draws RGUI into a 320×240 buffer and scales it. The existing scale options do not make the glyphs larger. A font patch is not approved. The working menu stays as it is. This is an outstanding limitation, separate from Phase 13E.

##### B7. Quit through RetroArch menus

Objective: Close Content from a NextUI launch returns to NextUI and can write the automatic state. The standalone tool stays in RetroArch.

Status: Host-tested. MENU+START is unchanged.

##### B8. Native arcade BIOS lookup

Objective: let the pinned FBNeo and MAME 2003-Plus cores find BIOS archives themselves.

Status: Host-tested. The 2026-10-15 host test of `zlyme-arcade-stage` does not validate this policy. That stage is superseded. The lookup order is in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`.

### Phase 13C. PortMaster on two cards

##### C1. Installed ports on both cards

Objective: show installed ports from both cards, and still write an install, update, or removal to the card that owns it.

Status: Blocked. PortMaster-GUI has one ports directory. Two ports with the same name cannot both live there. This is an outstanding limitation, separate from Phase 13E. It is not implemented.

REJECTED — a union or a symlink farm. A removal or extract can hit the wrong card. NextUI already lists each card's Ports folder. An upstream change would have to record which directory owns each port. No such change is approved.

##### C2. Cover art

Objective: after an install, publish suitable art as `.media/<launcher>.png` on that port's card. Art the user already chose stays.

Status: Host-tested. A JPEG is published only when the bytes are a PNG. This was not run on a Flip.

### Phase 13D. Samba and lid suspend

##### D1. Samba authentication

Objective: require the `zlyme` account, keep a changed password across reboot and update, and leave guest access off. Samba stays off until Settings enables it.

Status: Host-tested. A damaged `/storage/.config/zlyme/samba.account` does not start `smbd`, including when a tmpfs account is already loaded. `zlyme-samba-auth set` is the recovery and does not restore the public password. The host test stubs `smbpasswd` and `pdbedit`. The target binaries were not executed. There is no Windows client in the test. No NetBIOS, `nmbd`, or WS-Discovery.

##### D2. Lid-close deep suspend

Objective: one lid close requests the existing mem path once, in the menu and in a pak. A second close in that closed period does not. The power button stays on the same helper.

Status: Host-tested. NextUI `7cb6ecaa` and `zlyme-keylidmon` share that path. A switch sample that reads open clears the period when the open event was missed. The DTS was not changed. Lid-open wake was not tried on a Flip.

### Phase 13E. Final compatibility

13E is the last integration pass for `zlyme44.3`. 13E1, 13E2, and 13E3 are host-tested. 13E4 onward has not started.

#### 13E1. PortMaster mounts and MTP

A port can leave a mount nested under `/storage` after NextUI returns. USB File Transfer then rejects the primary storage because that tree contains a nested mount. A restart clears the case that was seen. The earlier AGS ports bind-mount under the NextUI state tree.

Objective: find which owner creates the mount and which step should release it. Keep MTP's check that refuses a nested mount. Do not recursively unmount `/storage`. Make the user-facing MTP error readable when the text is cut off.

This is Phase 13 because it breaks USB File Transfer. Broader port compatibility is Phase 14.

Status: Host-tested. Cleanup releases a mount only when `zlyme-portmaster-exec` recorded it. The one-launch snapshot under `/run/zlyme-portmaster/storage-before` is deleted at cleanup and is not an ownership list. An unrelated mount created between launches, or while the port is running, stays mounted. A mount created by calling `mount` outside the wrapper stays for the same reason. USB File Transfer still refuses the primary storage while such a mount remains. The screen says another filesystem is mounted inside storage. A busy recorded mount stays registered and is tried again. Library roots and the second card stay mounted. The host tests use a fake mount table. They do not reproduce the Flip leak, and this was not run on a Flip.

#### 13E2. Syncthing credentials

Objective: a new Syncthing config gets GUI username `zlyme` and password `zlyme`, stored as Syncthing 2.0.13's supported hash, not as plaintext in the saved XML. Syncthing stays off until the user enables it. The GUI listens on `0.0.0.0:8384` today and must not be reachable without authentication. Generate the normal per-device identity. Do not ship a fixed device ID, TLS key, or API key. Do not replace a config the user already has, on boot or on update. The user changes the GUI login in Syncthing's own page. There is no Settings password row. If setup fails, do not start an open GUI. The default password is public and the guide says to change it.

Status: Host-tested. A new home is created with `syncthing generate` before the listener starts. The GUI user is `zlyme` and the password is a bcrypt hash of `zlyme`. `zlyme-syncthing-gui` parses `config.xml` with Python's ElementTree and follows Syncthing 2.0.13 `IsAuthEnabled`: LDAP, or a nonempty user and password. An XML comment is not a credential. More than one `gui`, `user`, `password`, or `authMode` element refuses startup. An existing authenticated `config.xml` is not rewritten. A missing, commented, or ambiguous login does not start `0.0.0.0:8384`. The host test ran Syncthing 2.0.13 from the pinned source, checked the hash with its bcrypt package from a temporary module, logged in on `127.0.0.1`, and confirmed that a commented GUI section leaves that binary unauthenticated on loopback. That was not a Flip test.

#### 13E3. About credentials

Objective: Settings → About shows, in order, SSH account, SSH password, Samba account, Samba password, Syncthing account, Syncthing password, then IP. Read them when About opens. Do not run the helpers on every redraw. Show the real usernames. Show `zlyme` as a password only when that default is still in force. After the user changes a Samba or Syncthing password, show that it was changed or that it cannot be read. Do not show a hash. Do not keep a second plaintext copy for this screen. Labels have to fit the Flip. About does not edit Samba or Syncthing passwords.

Status: Host-tested. NextUI `3f4120cc` reads the rows when About opens and keeps them for redraws. SSH still shows the live password. Samba shows `zlyme` only when the NT hash is still the initial password, `(changed)` when it is another valid hash, and `(unavailable)` otherwise. Syncthing asks `zlyme-syncthing-gui`, the same parser the init script uses. The account is the GUI user. The password is `(set)` when the parsed value is a bcrypt hash, and `(unavailable)` otherwise. An XML comment is not a username or a password. The page does not show the hash and does not start Syncthing to check it. The host test compiled the label functions and ran them against that helper. The page was not opened on a Flip.

#### 13E4. Obsolete configuration

Objective: remove Phase 12 and 13 scaffolding that is proven unused, and leave the one stock RetroArch configuration. Candidates include `board/my355/fsoverlay/etc/retroarch.cfg`, `ra-perf.cfg`, retired RGUI theme files, obsolete launcher references, the removed arcade stage, and temporary core mechanisms. Read the pinned RetroArch fallback before deleting `/etc/retroarch.cfg`. Review AetherSX2's edits of existing INI paths against the user-owned configuration rule, and keep ROM and card paths working. Do not delete a file because it only looks unused.

Status: Planned.

#### 13E5. Documentation coherence

Objective: make `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/UPSTREAMS.md`, `docs/DEVICE_PORTING.md`, `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/LOGBOOK.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` agree with current behavior. Link to evidence. Do not paste it twice. Dated logbook entries stay as they were written. The changelog stays short and user-facing.

Status: Planned.

#### 13E6. Source review and acceptance

Objective: review Phase 12 and 13 for ownership, persistent data, cleanup, first-boot order, dependencies, dead code, and duplicated policy. Run the host checks that match those paths. After the implementation is done, build one local candidate. The maintainer does the focused hardware acceptance, including the PortMaster mount that blocks MTP.

Do not reopen an accepted hardware campaign without a concrete regression. B6 stays a documented limit unless a bounded fix is approved separately. C1 stays a documented limit. Do not add an unsafe ports union.

Status: Planned. No image, OTA, or release is part of the planning record.

## Phase 14. PortMaster compatibility

Phase 14 starts only after Phase 13 is accepted and the integration checklist in `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` has put that result on `main`. It then starts on a new branch. Its aim is the broadest practical match with official PortMaster on the Miyoo Flip. It does not claim that every port runs. Research notes belong in `docs/research/`, not here.

### 14A. Capability baseline

Audit upstream PortMaster requirements, what this CFW reports, architecture tags, kernel features, graphics, input, runtimes, storage, display limits, and the Phase 13 logs of ports that failed. Write the exact support and the missing pieces. Do not advertise a capability the image does not have.

Status: Planned.

### 14B. ARMHF userspace

Find what AArch64 plus 32-bit ARM actually requires: the kernel compat config, the EABI and hard-float ABI, the dynamic linker, glibc, a multilib toolchain or a separate root, packaging, licenses, size, and PortMaster's runtimes.

Do not set `DEVICE_HAS_ARMHF=Y` until those 32-bit binaries run.

Status: Planned.

### 14C. Box86 and Box64

Keep the Box64 path that exists. Compare native Box86 with the ARMHF userspace and with the runtimes PortMaster expects. Do not duplicate the Wine integration or break current Box64 users.

Status: Planned.

### 14D. GL4ES and graphics

Evaluate OpenGL ES, GL4ES, SDL 1.2, SDL 2, SDL 3, KMS/DRM, WestonPack, Xwayland, the libmali and Panfrost choice, and the Vulkan limits. Keep graphics application-scoped. Do not add a permanent compositor.

Status: Planned.

### 14E. GPTK and input

Audit gptokeyb, gptokeyb2, `.gptk` files, PortMaster `control.txt`, the InputPlumber `xb360` map, gamepad enumeration, keyboard and mouse emulation, and EXIT hotkeys. Shards of God is one regression case.

Status: Planned.

### 14F. Shared runtimes

Audit runtime download and install, squashfs mount and teardown, AArch64 and ARMHF discovery, SDL, OpenAL, PulseAudio where a port requires it, Mono, `taskset`, and `/usr/lib/compat`. Do not preinstall a large runtime without a demonstrated need.

Status: Planned.

### 14G. Named ports

Use the maintainer's logs. The cases are Shards of God, LISA The Painful, Rakuen, Steel Assault, Skautfold: In Sanity, If On A Winter's Night, Four Travelers, and Mina the Hollower. Separate an OS bug, a missing dependency, a port packaging problem, missing commercial data, and a real GPU or hardware limit.

`systemctl` was reported missing.

REJECTED — a fake `systemctl`, until the commands those ports actually run are known.

Status: Planned.

### 14H. Acceptance

Build a small matrix of CPU and ABI, graphics, and input categories. Say what the hardware cannot do. Do not claim every PortMaster game works. Do not ship a third-party runtime until its license and provenance are checked.

Status: Planned.
