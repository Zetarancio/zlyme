# Maintenance

This is the maintainer index. The documents below own the detail. This page says which one to open.

| Question | Document |
| --- | --- |
| How an agent should change this tree | `AGENTS.md` |
| Design priorities | `docs/ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md` |
| What the system is | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| How a device is isolated | `docs/DEVICE_PORTING.md` |
| How to build | `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| Live device, recovery, updates | `docs/OPERATIONS.md` |
| Where a version or patch comes from | `docs/UPSTREAMS.md` |
| Which source is the hardware authority | `docs/UPSTREAMS.md` |
| Pinned Buildroot, Linux, U-Boot, BL31; compiler `-O2` pins | `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| Governor CPU floors (SpruceOS-derived) | `docs/UPSTREAMS.md`, `docs/DEVICE_PORTING.md` |
| Which phase is active | `docs/ROADMAP.md` |
| Why a past choice was made | `docs/decisions/` and `docs/research/` |

The accepted Phase 9 runtime is `337ccbce2587393463a4b49c551f94e33e318e44` (`zlyme44`). A later documentation commit does not replace that SHA. Its acceptance record is in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Kernel and board patches

1. Name the Linux version this tree builds before comparing anything else (`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, Pinned baseline).
2. Check upstream Linux for that behavior.
3. Then look at official ROCKNIX `next` RK3566 work at a pinned commit.
4. Hardware facts come from `Zetarancio/Miyoo-Flip-Mainline-Linux-Reverse-Engineering`.
5. `Zetarancio/distribution` is archived ROCKNIX evidence. Do not treat it as the current tree.

Classify every local or borrowed patch as upstream, backport, board-specific, still required, or obsolete. Keep provenance and authorship. A hardware-facing change needs hardware revalidation. `docs/UPSTREAMS.md` and `docs/DEVICE_PORTING.md` own the rest.

## Emulator, core, and package updates

The project's own upstream is the version and source authority. Active KNULLI and ROCKNIX recipes are packaging references. Compare version, dependencies, options, patches, and license. Do not import another distribution's integration because the recipe exists.

Keep Zlyme's direct KMS, input, audio, and storage contracts. Build the package by itself before a full image. Hardware smoke is for a runtime change, not for a comment or a pin that does not change behavior. Procedure: `docs/UPSTREAMS.md`. Build mechanics: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Vendored helpers

`minui-list` 0.15.2 and `minui-presenter` 0.13.2 are vendored snapshots. Repository, tag, commit, and license are recorded in `package/system/minui-list/UPSTREAM` and `package/system/minui-presenter/UPSTREAM`. parson `ec53fb65` is the JSON helper vendored beside minui-list because upstream gitignores the directory the compiler includes. Stay on those recorded commits until a review says otherwise. Do not comment that vendored source for style.

ZcrapeGoat is not a patch stack and not a submodule. `package/system/zcrapegoat/src` is a pristine upstream v2.3.0 import, then ordinary Zlyme commits. A later update imports a new pinned revision. Do not follow upstream HEAD. Record: `package/system/zcrapegoat/src/UPSTREAM` and `docs/UPSTREAMS.md`.

## NextUI fork

`Zetarancio/NextUI` is the fork. Buildroot pins one commit on branch `zlyme` (`NEXTUI_VERSION` in `package/system/nextui/nextui.mk`). Review LoveRetro changes deliberately. Do not rebase the fork onto upstream HEAD to look current. Keep other-platform source in the fork. Hardware equivalence is required when runtime behavior changes, not for a documentation-only pin note.

## Releases

This section owns the release and delta policy. The code is `scripts/zlyme_release.py` and `scripts/make-release-deltas.py`.

- `zlymeNN` is a baseline: a full OTA and a manifest with zero deltas. `zlymeNN.0` is not a version.
- A point release `zlymeNN.M` builds deltas from the same-major baseline and from up to the last three earlier point releases of that major. A base must publish a manifest whose full OTA and root hashes verify. Other majors are never bases.
- Each delta is round-trip verified. A delta at or above 70% of the full OTA size is not published.
- Settings picks the smallest delta whose `from_sha256` exactly matches the installed `/boot/zlyme` SHA-256, otherwise the full OTA. The displayed version string does not select anything.

`./build.sh` writes a full OTA only. The GitHub release job writes `release-manifest.json` and any deltas. The clean GitHub `Build` from the accepted implementation SHA is the release artifact. Release notes describe accepted user behavior, not this log. Architecture of the apply path is in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. The device runbook is in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.
