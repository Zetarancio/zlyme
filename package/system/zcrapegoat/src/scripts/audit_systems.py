"""Inventory and coverage audit for NextUI ROM-folder suffixes.

Discovers every emulator suffix that a NextUI install can produce -- from the
bundled skeleton and from the Pak Store -- verifies what each suffix actually
means, and compares that against the shipped ScrapeGoat catalog.

Two modes:

  full (default)    Requires resources/systems.json. Reports provider coverage.
  --inventory-only  Never reads the catalog. Certifies discovery only; its
                    output is labelled "coverage not evaluated" and can never
                    stand in for the committed coverage report.

Standard library only. Network access is required for the storefront and for
release resolution; responses are cached under .cache/audit_systems so repeat
runs stay cheap and reviewable.
