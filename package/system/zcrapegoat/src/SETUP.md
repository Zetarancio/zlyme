# ScrapeGoat Pak — Setup Guide

## Credentials

ScrapeGoat requires ScreenScraper.fr **developer credentials** to function. These are embedded into the binary at build time via the Makefile (not loaded at runtime).

### Required: Developer Credentials

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` | Developer ID from screenscraper.fr |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD` | Developer password from screenscraper.fr |

Without these, the build will fail (`make check-credentials` runs automatically). With developer credentials only, scraping works at a limited rate (~1 request/min, single-threaded).

### GitHub Actions

Configure repository Actions secrets named `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` and
`SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD` with the same developer credentials used locally.
The reusable Build workflow receives them from Release, builds on an ARM64
runner, and uploads `ScrapeGoat.pak.zip`. The Release workflow publishes new
`pak.json` versions on `main` using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no personal
access token is needed.

Pull requests build with placeholder credentials, including fork PRs. Their
artifacts verify packaging but cannot authenticate developer requests to
ScreenScraper. Debug passwords and forced API levels are not used in releases.

### Optional: User Credentials

End users can configure their personal ScreenScraper.fr username and password via the in-app **Settings** screen. This unlocks higher rate limits (100+ requests/min, multi-threaded), depending on the user's API tier. User credentials are stored locally on the device at `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/settings.json` and are never committed to git.

### Optional: Debug Credentials

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SCREENSCRAPER_DEBUG_PASSWORD` | Debug password from screenscraper.fr (limited to 100 uses/day) |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_FORCE_LEVEL` | Override user level for thread count testing (e.g. `30`, `50`) |
| `SCREENSCRAPER_FORCE_UPDATE` | Set to `1` to force API cache refresh during testing |

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image libcurl pkg-config
```

**Embedded device builds** (tg5040/tg5050/my355/h700):
- Docker with ARM64 support
- GNU Make

### 2. Set Up Developer Credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and replace the placeholders with real credentials:

```bash
SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID=your_actual_dev_id
SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD=your_actual_dev_password
```

**How this works:** The Makefile includes `.env.local` directly (`-include .env.local`) and passes the values as C preprocessor defines (`-DSCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID=\"...\"`) at compile time. No runtime environment variables are needed.

### 3. Obtain Developer Credentials

1. Visit [screenscraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) and create an account
2. Go to the forums and request developer API access
3. Your account will be approved and you'll receive your `dev_id` and `dev_password` via the developer dashboard
4. Add them to `.env.local`

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
make run-mac        # Build + run macOS development binary
```

If credentials are missing or still contain placeholders, the build will fail with:

```
ERROR: set SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID and SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD in .env.local or the environment
```

See the [README](README.md#building) for all build targets (`make tg5040`, `make package`, `make deploy`, etc.).

## Deployment

### Embedded Devices (TG5040/TG5050/MY355/H700)

Credentials are baked into the binary at build time. The deployed `.pak` contains no `.env` files or plaintext secrets — only the compiled binary with embedded credentials.

```bash
# Build, package, and deploy via ADB (auto-detects device platform)
make deploy

# Or package for manual SD card installation
make package
```

## Runtime Notes

### Background mode handoff

If you quit ScrapeGoat with pending work and choose **Exit to Background**, the app writes the full queue to `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/daemon/`, starts a headless daemon, and exits. When ScrapeGoat is launched again, the foreground app requests a handoff, the daemon persists a final queue snapshot and exits, and the queue resumes locally in the normal Progress screen with completed and failed entries preserved.

### Background daemon files

The daemon stores its runtime files under:

```
~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/daemon/
```

Important files:
- `daemon.log` — background-mode log output
- `queue.json` — persisted queue snapshot used for recovery and relaunch handoff
- `daemon.pid`, `daemon.lock`, `daemon.control`, `settings.json` — internal IPC/runtime files


## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env.local` to git** — `.gitignore` protects you, but be careful
2. **`.env.example` contains only placeholders** — review it before updating `.env.local`
3. **Credentials are case-sensitive** — `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` ≠ `screenscraper_dev_id`
4. **Log sanitization** — the app strips `sspassword` and `devpassword` values from logged URLs
5. **User credentials** are stored as plaintext JSON at `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/settings.json` on the device (not tracked by git)

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "credentials not found"
- Ensure `.env.local` exists and contains real values (not placeholders)
- Run `make check-credentials` to verify

### "API rate limit exceeded" or slow scraping
- Developer-only mode is limited to ~1 request/min
- Configure your personal ScreenScraper.fr credentials in **Settings** for higher limits

### "Invalid username/password" (user credentials)
- User credentials are configured via the in-app **Settings** screen, not `.env.local`
- Go to **Settings** and enter your screenscraper.fr username and password

### Background handoff or resume issues
- Check the normal app log at `~/.userdata/<platform>/logs/scrapegoat.log`
- Check the daemon log at `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/daemon/daemon.log`
- If the daemon directory still exists after a failed resume, `queue.json` is the recovery snapshot ScrapeGoat will try to import on the next launch

## File Overview

| File | Purpose | In Git? |
|------|---------|---------|
| `.env.example` | Shows required variables with placeholders | Yes |
| `.env.local` | Your actual developer credentials | No (`.gitignore`) |
| `Makefile` | Reads `.env.local` and embeds credentials via `-D` flags | Yes |
| `src/screenscraper.c` | Uses embedded credential defines at compile time | Yes |
| `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/settings.json` | User credentials & app settings (on device) | No |
| `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/daemon/` | Background-mode queue state, IPC files, and daemon log (on device) | No |
