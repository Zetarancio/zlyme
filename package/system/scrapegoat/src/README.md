# ScrapeGoat

A [NextUI](https://github.com/LoveRetro/NextUI) Pak that scrapes artwork and manuals from [ScreenScraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) and downloads cheats from [Libretro](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database) for your ROM library on `tg5040`, `tg5050`, `my355`, and `h700` devices.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Device | Screen | Build |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `tg5040` (TG5040) | TrimUI Smart Pro | 1280×720 | Docker (ARM64) |
| `tg5040` (TG3040) | TrimUI Brick | 1024×768 | Docker (ARM64) |
| `tg5050` | TrimUI Smart Pro S | 1280×720 | Docker (ARM64) |
| `my355` | Miyoo Flip | 640x480 | Docker (ARM64) |
| `h700` | Anbernic H700 devices | Varies | Docker (ARM64) |

> The Brick and Smart Pro share the same `tg5040` filesystem layout (tools, roms, settings paths are identical). The pak auto-detects the Brick via the `DEVICE` environment variable (`"brick"` vs `"smartpro"`), which NextUI's `launch.sh` exports at startup.

## What It Does

- Scrapes cover art and media from ScreenScraper.fr for all your ROMs
- Downloads PDF game manuals from ScreenScraper.fr to a configurable directory
- Automatically detects your ROM library by console and game count
- Choose to scrape **missing only** (skip games with existing artwork/manuals) or **all ROMs** (overwrite existing)
- Downloads `.cht` cheat files from the Libretro cheat database for supported systems
- Live progress tracking with thread count, ETA, and API quota display
- Can hand an active queue to a background daemon on quit, then automatically resume it in the foreground when ScrapeGoat is reopened
- Configurable artwork priority (20 media types available including covers, wheels, fan art, and more)
- Configurable region priority (USA, Europe, Japan, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, World, and more)
- Recognises all 64 ROM-folder suffixes a current NextUI install can produce, from the bundled skeleton and every Pak Store emulator
- Ships the full ScreenScraper platform list, so any folder can be pointed at any of 250 platforms; 37 of them also have a Libretro cheat database
- Lets you choose what a folder holds when its suffix does not say — a GPGX folder can be Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear, SG-1000 or Mega CD
- Shows detailed scraping summary (Total / Found / Not Found / Errors)
- Fully supports multi-disc games, CUE/BIN disc images, and zip-archived ROMs
- Handles MD5 hashing with automatic fallback to filename-only matching
- Lets you cancel in-progress work at any time without losing completed downloads

## Usage

1. Launch **ScrapeGoat** from the NextUI Tools menu
2. Pick one of:
   - **Artwork** — Download cover art and media for your ROM library
   - **Cheats** — Get `.cht` cheat files for your games
   - **Manuals** — Download PDF game manuals (requires a download directory to be set in Settings)
   - **Settings** — Configure credentials, artwork priority, region priority, and manual download directory
3. Follow the on-screen prompts
4. If you quit while a queue still has unfinished items, choose **Exit to Background** to keep it running after exit. Reopening **ScrapeGoat** automatically takes the queue back from the daemon and drops you into the normal **Progress** screen.

## Background Handoff

When you exit with pending work, ScrapeGoat offers three choices:

- **Keep ScrapeGoat Open** — Cancel quitting and keep the queue running in the foreground
- **Exit and Cancel Downloads** — Close the app immediately and abandon the remaining queue state
- **Exit to Background** — Hand the full queue to a headless daemon and exit the app

Background mode is an exit-time handoff, not a second long-lived session. The daemon keeps processing until it finishes, you stop it from the background status view, or you relaunch ScrapeGoat. On relaunch, the foreground app requests ownership back, the daemon writes a final queue snapshot and exits, and ScrapeGoat resumes the same queue locally with completed and failed items still visible.

## Menu Options

### Scrape Artwork

1. **Launch the scrape** — The app uses embedded developer credentials. For optimal speeds, configure your ScreenScraper.fr user credentials in Settings (see [Credentials](#credentials) below).
2. **Pick a console** — Choose which system to scrape (only systems with ScreenScraper support are shown)
3. **Choose scrape mode:**
   - **Scrape missing only** — Skip games that already have artwork, faster for reruns
   - **Scrape all** — Overwrite existing artwork, useful for switching to a different art style
4. **Watch the live scrape** — Real-time progress shows:
   - **ROMs left** — Remaining games in the current batch
   - **Threads** — How many parallel requests the API allows for your account
   - **ETA** — Estimated time to completion (exponential moving average)
   - **Quota** — Your daily API request usage (e.g. `90/20000`)
5. **Stop, background, or wait** — Press **Y** to stop early and keep completed items, or quit and choose **Exit to Background** to let the remaining queue continue after the app exits
6. **Review summary** — See Total / Found / Not Found / Errors

Fifty-seven ROM-folder suffixes map to a ScreenScraper platform out of the box, covering
every emulator in the NextUI skeleton and every emulator in the Pak Store. Any other folder
can be pointed at any of the 250 platforms ScreenScraper knows — see
[System Mappings](#system-mappings). [SYSTEMS.md](SYSTEMS.md) lists every suffix, what it
targets, and the evidence behind that.

### Download Cheats

1. **Pick a console** — Choose which system to download cheats for (only systems with Libretro cheat support are shown)
2. **Watch the download progress** — Shows current ROM being matched
3. **Review summary** — See Total / Downloaded / Not Found / Errors

The pak downloads cheats from the official [Libretro cheat database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/tree/master/cht) and matches them to your ROM files by normalized name. It also understands some multi-title cheat filenames such as `Title A _ Title B`, so alternate regional titles can still resolve to the same cheat file. When multiple cheat files exist for the same game (e.g. different regions), ScrapeGoat picks the one that best matches your ROM's region and your configured region priority. See [How Matching Works](#how-matching-works) for details.

Thirty-seven suffixes reach a Libretro cheat database out of the box. A platform can have
artwork and no cheats, cheats and no artwork, or both; the picker shows which, and a folder
only appears under **Cheats** when the platform you chose has a cheat database.

### Download Manuals

1. **Set a download directory** — Before downloading manuals, go to **Settings → Manual download directory** and choose where to save them. You can create new folders from within the file picker.
2. **Pick a console** — Choose which system to download manuals for (only systems with ScreenScraper support are shown)
3. **Choose download mode:**
   - **Download missing only** — Skip games that already have a manual
   - **Re-download all** — Overwrite existing manuals
4. **Watch the live download** — Same real-time progress as artwork scraping (threads, ETA, quota)
5. **Background or wait** — Quit and choose **Exit to Background** if you want the remaining manual queue to continue after exit
6. **View manuals** — You'll need a PDF viewer Pak like **SDLReader** installed on your device to open the downloaded PDFs

Manuals are region-aware and use the same **Region Priority** as artwork. The ScreenScraper API provides manuals for many (but not all) games — games without a manual are counted as "Not Found" in the summary.

### Settings

Configure your ScreenScraper credentials, customize artwork and region priority, set the manual download directory, and control visibility of hidden/disabled ROMs.

#### ScreenScraper Credentials

**Developer Credentials** (embedded at build time)
- Your ScrapeGoat binary includes embedded ScreenScraper.fr developer credentials
- These enable scraping at **limited rate**: ~1 request per minute, single-threaded
- Required; the app will not function without them

**User Credentials** (configured in Settings) — *Optional*
- Your personal ScreenScraper.fr username and password
- Greatly increases rate limit: 100+ requests per minute
- Enables multi-threaded scraping (threads based on your API tier)
- Saved locally in `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/settings.json` (never committed to git)
- Leave blank if you prefer to scrape at the basic rate with developer credentials only

**In summary:**
- Without user credentials: Scraping works but is slow (~1 req/min, single-threaded)
- With user credentials: Much faster (100+ req/min, multiple threads possible depending on your user level)
- User credentials are **always optional** — the app works either way

#### Artwork Priority

Reorderable list of media types. The order determines which artwork is downloaded when multiple options are available:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Box art (2D) | Traditional 2D game cover (most common) |
| Box art (3D) | 3D rendered box art |
| Mix Recalbox V1 | Custom composite artwork (Recalbox style v1) |
| Mix Recalbox V2 | Custom composite artwork (Recalbox style v2) |
| Screenshot (title) | Title screen or fade-in |
| Screenshot (in-game) | Gameplay screenshot |
| Fan art | Community-created artwork |
| Wheel | Wheel logo / game title graphic |
| Wheel (carbon) | Wheel logo with carbon fiber effect |
| Wheel (steel) | Wheel logo with steel effect |

Default order: Box art 2D → Box art 3D → Mix Recalbox V1 → Screenshots

Use **X** to reorder, **START** to save.

#### Region Priority

Reorderable list of regions for matching the best artwork:

| Region | Code |
|--------|------|
| USA | us |
| Europe | eu |
| Japan | jp |
| World | wor |
| France | fr |
| Germany | de |
| Spain | es |
| Italy | it |
| Portugal | pt |
| ScreenScraper | ss |

Default order: USA → Europe → Japan → World  
By default, **Custom/Homebrew** (`cus`) is always appended as a last resort if no regional match is found.

Use **X** to reorder, **START** to save.

#### Manual Download Directory

Browse and select a directory where downloaded PDF manuals will be saved. You can create new directories from within the file picker. This must be set before downloading manuals — selecting **Manuals** from the main menu without a directory set will show a reminder.

Example path: `/mnt/SDCARD/Manuals`

| Option | Default |
|--------|---------|
| Manual download directory | **(not set)** |

#### Show hidden/disabled ROMs

When **Off** (default), the ROM and console pickers hide:
- Folders and files that start with `.` (dot-prefixed)
- Folders and files that end in `.disabled`

Turn this **On** to include those entries in your scrape. Useful if you want to include your `.disabled` consoles or hidden games in the scrape run.

| Option | Default |
|--------|---------|
| Show hidden/disabled | **Off** |

## System Mappings

NextUI picks an emulator from a ROM folder's suffix: `Roms/Game Boy Advance (GBA)/` runs
whatever `GBA.pak` is installed. That suffix names an *emulator*, which is not always one
scraping platform. Genesis Plus GX ships as a single `GPGX` pak whose documentation asks for
five folders — Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear, SG-1000 and Mega CD — all sharing the
`GPGX` suffix. No single bundled default can be right for all five, so ScrapeGoat asks.

### Choosing what a folder holds

A folder with no platform is listed as **unmapped** rather than hidden, in every mode it
could reach. Open it, or press **X** on any row, to pick a platform. **Settings → System
Mappings** does the same from one screen, listing unmapped folders first.

The picker offers likely matches first — an exact match on the folder's own name, then the
reviewed candidates for its suffix — followed by every platform A–Z. Press **Y** to search by
name, alias or id. Each row shows whether that platform has artwork, cheats, or both.

### Scopes and precedence

Two scopes are available, and they resolve highest-first:

1. **This folder** — applies to that folder alone
2. **Suffix default** — your own default for every folder with that suffix
3. **Bundled default** — what ScrapeGoat ships for that suffix

A folder's own choice always wins over a suffix default, which wins over the bundled one.
Clearing a choice exposes the next one down: clear a folder override and its suffix default
applies again; clear that and the bundled default returns. An ambiguous suffix like `GPGX`
has no bundled default, so clearing everything leaves the folder unmapped again.

Your choices live in `/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/system_overrides.json`,
separate from the shipped catalog, so a pak update never overwrites them.

For Mac UI testing, run `make setup-mock-sdcard` to add five folders sharing
`GPGX` under `mock_sdcard/Roms/`: Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear, SG-1000,
and Mega CD. Each contains a distinct, non-playable placeholder ROM so it appears
in the library even with empty folders excluded. The setup preserves existing
files and saved mappings; choose each folder's platform in the mapping picker.

### Hiding a folder

**Hide this folder** removes a folder from the library without forgetting its platform, and
without touching any other folder that shares its suffix. Hidden folders stay listed in
Settings → System Mappings, where you can show them again.

Hiding is a preference, not a capability. A folder that disappears from **Cheats** because
the platform you chose has no cheat database is a different thing, and the picker says which
platforms do.

### Renaming a folder

A mapping is keyed by the folder's name relative to `Roms/`, exactly as spelled — including
a `.disabled` suffix. Renaming a folder, or toggling `.disabled`, therefore makes it a new
folder as far as mappings go: it falls back to the suffix default until you map it again.
The old entry is kept and listed as **folder missing** in Settings so you can clear it.
Moving the SD card, or mounting it somewhere else, changes nothing.

### While work is queued

Mapping changes apply to newly queued work. A job that is already queued keeps the platform
it was queued with, all the way through a background handoff, so mappings cannot be edited
while anything is pending. Let the queue finish or cancel it first.

### Limits

Cheats and manuals are written to per-suffix directories, which NextUI expects. Two folders
that share a suffix therefore share those output directories, and two identically named
games in `Mega Drive (GPGX)` and `Master System (GPGX)` would collide. Give them distinct
names, or use suffixes that differ.

Selection is per folder. A folder holds one platform; mixed content needs separate folders.

## How Matching Works

### Artwork (ScreenScraper)

When scraping artwork, each ROM is identified through a two-step lookup against the [ScreenScraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr) API:

1. **MD5 hash match** — ScrapeGoat computes the MD5 checksum and file size of the ROM content and sends them to the API. This is the most accurate method because it identifies the exact ROM dump regardless of filename.
   - For **zip archives**, the largest file inside the zip is hashed (the actual ROM, not the archive itself).
   - For **multi-disc folders** (containing an `.m3u` file) and **CUE/BIN folders** (containing a `.cue` file), the primary disc image is hashed (first track found by extension priority: `.chd` → `.iso` → `.bin` → `.img`).
2. **Filename fallback** — If the hash lookup returns no results (e.g. a patched ROM or homebrew), ScrapeGoat retries using the ROM filename only.

If neither method finds a match, the ROM is counted as "Not Found" in the summary.

Once a game is identified, ScrapeGoat picks the best artwork using your **Artwork Priority** list (e.g. Box art 2D → Box art 3D → Mix → Screenshots) and **Region Priority** list (e.g. USA → Europe → Japan → World). It tries each artwork type in order, and for each type tries your preferred regions first.

### Manuals (ScreenScraper)

Manual downloads use the same two-step ROM identification as artwork:

1. **MD5 hash match** — Most accurate, identifies the exact ROM dump
2. **Filename fallback** — Retries using the ROM filename if the hash lookup fails

Once a game is identified, ScrapeGoat looks for a manual (`manuel` media type in the ScreenScraper API) using your **Region Priority** list. Manuals are downloaded as PDF files — no image conversion is performed. Not all games have manuals available in the ScreenScraper database.

### Cheats (Libretro)

Cheat matching uses **normalized name comparison** between your ROM filenames and the [Libretro cheat database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/tree/master/cht) filenames:

1. Both the ROM display name (filename without extension) and the cheat filename are normalized by:
   - Stripping all parenthetical groups — `(USA)`, `(Europe)`, `(Rev 1)`, `(Code Breaker)`, etc.
   - Converting to lowercase
   - Removing all punctuation
   - Collapsing whitespace
2. If the normalized names match exactly, the cheat file is a candidate.
3. Some Libretro cheat filenames contain **alternate titles** separated by a literal ` _ `, for example `Bare Knuckle II - Shitou e no Requiem _ Streets of Rage II (Japan, Europe).cht`. In those cases, ScrapeGoat also indexes each side as an alias when every segment still looks like a standalone multi-word game title after normalization.
4. This alias handling is intentionally conservative. It does **not** treat every ` _ ` as an alternate-title separator, so joiner-style titles such as `Dungeons _ Dragons`, `Game _ Watch`, or `Mario _ Luigi` do not create bogus alias-only matches.

ScrapeGoat still uses **exact normalized matching** after that indexing step. It does not use fuzzy matching or generic substring matching.

**Region-aware selection:** The Libretro cheat database often contains multiple cheat files for the same game with different region tags (e.g. `Castlevania (USA) (Code Breaker).cht` and `Castlevania (Europe) (Code Breaker).cht`). When multiple candidates match the same ROM, ScrapeGoat picks the best one using this priority:

1. **Direct region overlap** — A cheat file whose region tags match the ROM's region tags is preferred. For example, a `(USA)` ROM will prefer a `(USA)` or `(USA, Europe)` cheat over a `(Japan)` one.
2. **World** — A cheat tagged `(World)` is treated as universal and preferred over a region mismatch.
3. **User's region priority** — If no direct match exists, your configured **Region Priority** (from Settings) is used as a tiebreaker.
4. **No region tag** — Cheats without any region marker are used as a neutral fallback.

Within each tier, **plain cheat files are preferred over device-specific variants** such as `(Game Genie)` and `(Action Replay)`. For example, if both `Super Mario Bros. (World).cht` and `Super Mario Bros. (World) (Game Genie).cht` exist, the plain file is always chosen.

Region keywords are recognized from parenthetical groups in filenames: `USA`, `Europe`, `Japan`, `World`, `France`, `Germany`, `Spain`, `Italy`, `Portugal`, `Australia`, `Korea`, `China`, `Taiwan`, and their common abbreviations (`US`, `EU`, `JP`, `FR`, `DE`, etc.). Non-region tags like `(Code Breaker)`, `(SGB Enhanced)`, and `(Rev 1)` are ignored.

For example, if you have `Pokemon - Emerald Version (USA, Europe).gba` and the Libretro database has both `Pokemon - Emerald Version (USA, Europe) (Code Breaker).cht` and `Pokemon - Feuerrote Edition (G).cht`, only the first matches (both normalize to `pokemon emerald version`). If there were a `(Japan)` variant too, the `(USA, Europe)` one would be selected because it directly overlaps with the ROM's regions.

Another example: `Streets of Rage II (Japen, Europe) (En,Ja)` can match `Bare Knuckle II - Shitou e no Requiem _ Streets of Rage II (Japan, Europe).cht` because `Streets of Rage II` is indexed as an alternate title from that cheat filename.

Existing cheat files on your device are never overwritten — if a `.cht` already exists for a ROM, it is skipped.

## Artwork Storage

Scraped artwork is saved as PNG files in your ROM directories:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/Roms/Game Boy Advance (GBA)/
  .media/
    Pokemon Emerald.png
    Pokemon FireRed.png
    ...
```

The pak stores one `.png` per game in a `.media/` subfolder. Your ROM files are untouched.

## Cheat Storage

Downloaded cheats are organized by system:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/Cheats/
  GBA/
    Pokemon Emerald.cht
    Pokemon FireRed.cht
    ...
  GBC/
    ...
```

Cheat files are matched to your ROMs by normalized game name. If a cheat file already exists on your device, it is skipped (not re-downloaded).

## Manual Storage

Downloaded manuals are saved as PDF files in your configured download directory, organized by system tag:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/Manuals/
  GBA/
    Pokemon Emerald.pdf
    Pokemon FireRed.pdf
    ...
  GBC/
    ...
```

The download directory is configurable via **Settings → Manual download directory**. System subdirectories are created automatically.

## Credentials

### How Credentials Work

ScrapeGoat uses two types of ScreenScraper.fr credentials:

**1. Developer Credentials** (embedded in the binary)
- Provided by ScreenScraper.fr for application developers
- Embedded at **build time** via the Makefile (`-ldflags`)
- Required for any scraping to work
- Provides basic API access (~1 request/minute, single-threaded)
- Used by maintainers building the ScrapeGoat binary; end users don't need to obtain these separately

**2. User Credentials** (configured via Settings) — *Optional for faster scraping*
- Your personal ScreenScraper.fr username and password
- Stored locally on your device in `~/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/settings.json`
- When configured, provides much higher rate limits (100+ requests/minute, multiple threads)
- Configure via **Settings → Username/Password** in the app
- Leave empty if you prefer basic speed with developer credentials only

### Getting User Credentials (Optional)

If you want faster scraping speeds:

1. Visit [screenscraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/)
2. Create an account
3. In the app, go to **Settings** and enter your ScreenScraper.fr username and password
4. Now your scrapes will use your personal account's higher rate limits

Without user credentials, scraping still works but at ~1 request per minute (single-threaded).

## Logging

Logs are written to:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/<platform>/logs/scrapegoat.log
```

When background mode is active, the daemon also writes to:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/daemon/daemon.log
```

The platform is read from the `PLATFORM` environment variable. If not set, it defaults to `tg5040`.

The background daemon keeps its runtime state under:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/shared/ScrapeGoat/daemon/
```

This directory contains the daemon log plus internal queue, PID, lock, control, and settings files used for handoff and recovery.

Logs include:
- API requests and responses
- Artwork/cheat downloads (success and errors)
- Settings load/save operations
- Error details and stack traces

## Building

### Prerequisites

**macOS (development):**
```bash
brew install go sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_gfx
```

**Embedded (tg5040/tg5050):**
- Docker with ARM64 support
- GNU Make

### First-Time Setup

> **Note:** Only developers/maintainers building the ScrapeGoat binary need to do this. If you're installing a pre-built `.pak.zip`, skip to [Installing on a Handheld](#installing-on-a-handheld).

If you're building from source, you need ScreenScraper.fr **developer credentials** to embed in the binary:

1. Visit [screenscraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) and request developer API access
2. You'll receive developer ID and password
3. Create `.env.local` with your developer credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Edit `.env.local` and add:
```bash
SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID=your_dev_id
SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD=your_dev_password
```

These are embedded in the binary at build time via the Makefile. The `.env.local` file is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed.

Embedded builds vendor their own curl/OpenSSL runtime bits and package `lib/cacert.pem` alongside the pak.

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the mac development binary
make mac

# Build one binary for every supported NextUI device
make universal
make

# Optional legacy regression builds
make tg5040
make tg5050
make my355

# Optional legacy per-platform bundles
make package-tg5040
make package-tg5050
make package-my355

# Build one platform-neutral Pak Store archive
make package

# See all targets
make help
```

`make mac` and `make run-mac` automatically run `setup-nextui-preview-cache` first. The cache
is stored under `.cache/nextui-preview/` and contains a sparse checkout of only:

- `skeleton/SYSTEM/res/assets@1x.png`
- `skeleton/SYSTEM/res/assets@2x.png`
- `skeleton/SYSTEM/res/assets@3x.png`
- `skeleton/SYSTEM/res/assets@4x.png`

The sparse checkout is pinned to `https://github.com/LoveRetro/NextUI.git` commit
`7d201cf293f3a253e09749b8bb002e0b9f66d652` (resolved from `main` on March 29, 2026). ScrapeGoat
also generates local `nextval.json` and `minuisettings.txt` preview fixtures in the same cache.

### Automated builds and releases

GitHub Actions runs the regression checks and builds the unified
`ScrapeGoat.pak.zip` on pull requests. PR artifacts use placeholder developer
credentials and are for build verification, not ScreenScraper downloads.

Every push to `main` runs the same build with the repository's ScreenScraper
developer secrets. If the version in `pak.json` has no GitHub Release yet, the
Release workflow publishes that version with its changelog and the single
`ScrapeGoat.pak.zip` asset. Existing releases are left unchanged. The workflows
also support manual runs; publishing is restricted to `main`.

For a new release, update `pak.json`'s version and changelog plus `SS_SOFT_NAME`
and `SS_USER_AGENT` in `src/screenscraper.h`, then merge to `main`. Keep
`release_filename` set to `ScrapeGoat.pak.zip`. See [CI credentials](SETUP.md#github-actions)
for repository setup.

## Installing on a Handheld

1. **Build and package:** `make package` for the universal Pak Store archive, or `make package-<platform>` for a legacy target.

2. **For a per-platform zip:**
   - Extract the contents of `ScrapeGoat.pak.zip` to your SD card as `Tools/<platform>/ScrapeGoat.pak/`
   - Replace `<platform>` with `tg5040`, `tg5050`, `my355`, or `h700`

3. **For Pak Store:** publish `build/release/all/ScrapeGoat.pak.zip`; Pak Store installs it into the current platform's Tools directory.

4. **Launch** from the NextUI Tools menu
